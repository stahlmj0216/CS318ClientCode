            <h1>Domestic Violence Awareness</h1>
            <h3>“Survivors of domestic violence have been put in a situation that has made it even more difficult to leave. Many survivors, especially those that are sole providers, may be in situations where they can’t miss a day of work to request help because they are the only source of income. Some who are not informed about their rights are in fear of losing their job because of domestic violence. Some fear becoming homeless if they leave the relationship. Economic justice is a prominent issue that affects survivors of domestic violence and needs to be addressed within ALL communities.”—Evelyn Magaña, Legal Advocate, Family Assistance Program</h3>
